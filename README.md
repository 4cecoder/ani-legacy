## Running React with Vite and Tailwind CSS

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (
HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build fast, responsive,
and beautiful user interfaces.

Using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS in conjunction is a fast and stylish way to build a web app.
